<u class="fz">Responsive Web Design</u>
<p>Responsive web design suggests that the approach of designing and developing a website should repond to the user's behavior and enviornment based on platform, orientation and screen size. The practice consists of a well organized HTML structure and a mix of flexible grids, customizable layouts and images of intelligent use of CSS and it's media queries. For example, as a user switches from a laptop to a tablet or phone, the website will automatically switch media to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abiliities. To put simply, the website will have the technology to automatically respond to the user's preferences and different devices. This eliminates the need for multiple different design and development phases for each new gadget that is new to the market.[3]</p>
