<u class="fz">Responsive Web Design</u>
<p>Responsive web design suggests that the approach of designing and developing a website should repond to the user's behavior and enviornment based on platform, orientation and screen size. The practice consists of a well organized HTML structure and a mix of flexible grids, customizable layouts and images of intelligent use of CSS and it's media queries. For example, as a user switches from a laptop to a tablet or phone, the website will automatically switch media to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abiliities. To put simply, the website will have the technology to automatically respond to the user's preferences and different devices. This eliminates the need for multiple different design and development phases for each new gadget that is new to the market.[3]</p>

    <u class="fz">Basic HTML and HTML5</u>
    <p>Hyper Text Markup Language, or better known as HTML, is a markup language to describe the structure of a web page much like a skeleton of a human body. An array of unique syntax of elements are used to organize and give information about the content to the web browser. Opening and closing tags are used on elements that surround content and gives meaning to it. There are different element tags that have different functions and uses that could include paragraphs, headers, links or lists.[4]</p>
  <p>This section references how to use HTML elements to give structure and meaning to your web content. Listed below are the topics covered for HTML and HTML5.</p>
  <p class="c">The Declaration | Comments | The Head | The Main/Body | Headings | Paragraphs | Lists | Divs | Images/Video | Anchors | Forms | Buttons</p>
  <p class="fz">The Declaration</p>
  <div class="container">
 <p>!DOCTYPE html</p>
    <p>html</p>
      <p>... ;!-- Your code here --</p>
    <p>/html</p>
  </div>
  <p class="fz">The Paragraph</p>
  <p>Paragraphs are the preferred element for communicating text on websites. Just like in real writing, p> tags organize and contain the meaning of the content within the body of the page.[9]</p>
  <div class="container">
  <p>body</p>
  <p>main</p>
  <p>h1>Your Title Here h1></p>
  </div>
  <p class="fz">The heading</p>
  <p>The heading element tells the browser about the structure of the website. h1> elements are often used for main headings as they are largest of the headings. h2> through h6> elements are generally used for subheadings to indicate different or new sections of your content.[8]</p>
  <div class="container">
  <p>body</p>
  <p>main</p>
  <p>h1>Your Title Here h1></p>
  </div>

<section id="basic css">
<u class="fz">Basic CSS</u>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets, better known as CSS, tells the browser how to display the HTML framework on the page. This language controls the colors, fonts, positioning, spacing, sizing, decorations and transistions of every element. There are three main ways for these languages to communicate with each other to properly display a webpage. Inline styles can be directly written in HTML within each element with the style attribute. Another way CSS rules can be applied to HTML is by adding  tags in the document and writing the withen those most used method is to write the CSS  in  external  sheet and have the document reference that sheet. This improves readability and reusability of the cod. The best way to remember how these languages function is reffering to the as the skeleton and CSS as the skin of  site.</p>
